# Solar spectropolarimetry

This project is a study on solar spectropolarimetry, focused on sunspots. By using data cubes obtained with the SOT (Solar Optical Telescope), mounted at the Hinode telescope, we have analyzed the Stokes profiles in order to study the electromagnetic field within the sunspot.

The data reduction and derivation is available in solar_data.py, while the study of the magnetic field and its properties is addresed in solar_graphics.py.
